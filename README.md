# calculator

I wrote this calculator to perform operations on polynomials.  I have successfully written functions that add and multiply polynomial functions, evaluate a polynomial at a given real number input, or factor a polynomial that is either linear or quadratic.

### Next steps

I want to create a program that will factor cubic polynomials.  This will require that polynomials are set up handle all operations with either real or complex inputs.  This is ready as of the most recent commit.
